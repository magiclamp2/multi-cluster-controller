# multi-cluster-controller
The Multicluster Controller is a tool to manage kubernetes clusters for DTNs.
With more and more k8s clusters getting deployed, the need for managing the DTN participation is inevitable in the near future. 
The DTN may be required to participate in different clusters at each time for different projects. 
Sometimes it may also be required to stop kubernetes service for some other non-k8s projects. 
As a result, this tool is created to facilitate a number of basic operations. 
It can be used as an alternative of federation solution.
